            # **EduVidBot â€“ AI-Powered Educational Video Generator**  

            ## **Overview**  
            EduVidBot is an AI-powered tool designed to generate educational videos based on user prompts. It creates engaging and interactive visual content to teach concepts in **mathematics, physics, and other STEM subjects**, making learning more effective and accessible.  

            ## **How It Works**  
            1. **User Input:** The user provides a prompt describing the concept they want to learn or explain. Example prompts:  
            - "Explain Newtonâ€™s Laws with real-life examples."  
            - "Derive the quadratic formula step by step."  
            - "Visualize the Pythagorean theorem with animations."  
            2. **AI Processing:** The bot processes the prompt, identifies key concepts, and generates an appropriate script, visuals, and animations.  
            3. **Video Generation:** The system converts the structured content into an educational video with:  
            - Step-by-step explanations  
            - Graphs, animations, and real-world examples  
            - Voice narration and subtitles  
            4. **Output:** The user receives a downloadable or shareable video file for learning or teaching purposes.  

            ## **Key Features**  
            âœ… **Concept-Based Video Creation:** Generates videos tailored to user-defined topics.
